## ðŸ’» Project

The Project forms a component of a series of challenges and milestones aimed at improvement throughout the course. Post-class, the students endeavour to independently replicate a particular task. In this instance, three simple exercises have been consolidated onto a single page and uploaded to GitHub.

## ðŸ”– Layout

<div align="center">
    <p>Web Layout:</p>
    <img src="./design/web-layout.png">
</div>

<div align="center">
    <p>Mobile and Tablet Layout:</p>
    <img src="./design/mobile-layout.png">
    <img src="./design/tablet-layout.png">
</div>

## :thought_balloon: Noteworthy Observations:

- [ ] The Responsive Menu in Mobile and Tablet operates as a Dropdown created solely using CSS, without any JavaScript assistance.

- [ ] The animations for the Menu and Arrow are compelling and may serve as inspiration for upcoming projects. It was a deliberate choice to make the Hero component relatively smaller in order to encourage users to scroll down and explore further.
